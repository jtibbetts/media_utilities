<h3>Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

<p></center></p>

<p>The following FAQs are intended to provide a bare-bones guide to getting started with Google tools.  There are plenty of in-depth tutorials for all of these tools on the web, especially in Youtube.  This document is customized to the needs of our group and should help the inexperienced user get started.</p>

<p>Important: If anyone needs help with any of this contact me at: <a href="mailto:john.tibbetts@kinexis.com">john.tibbetts@kinexis.com</a>.</p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>The Douglass Neighborhood Political Action Group (Douglass-PAG) will use Google Groups, Docs, and Sheets to enable us to work together.  We use them for group email communication, document creation, storage, spreadsheets etc.  These collaboration tools are widely used, free, and can be run using any standard email client and web browser.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Do I have to sign up with Google to use them?</em></strong></p>

<p>The simplest use of these tools do not require any sign-up.  Simple use includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sending an email to the whole group</p></li>
<li><p>Viewing group documents or spreadsheets that have been marked public</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However full tool use does require that you use or obtain a Google account.  Full use includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Creating or modifying documents or spreadsheets.</p></li>
<li><p>Commenting on documents</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewing historical email threads </p></li>
<li><p>And much more</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Where do I get a Google account?</em></strong></p>

<p>First, If your email address ends with ‘@gmail.com’ you already have a Google account.  Simply use your gmail address when logging in.  Use the password you usually use.  </p>

<p>If you don’t have a gmail account, it’s easy to get one at <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp">the Google signup page</a> and follow the instructions.  By default this page will create a new gmail account.  It doesn’t cost anything. You don’t need to use this for email,  but it will however provide you with access to Google tools.  </p>

<p>If you prefer using your current email address and don’t want a gmail account, press the link "I prefer to use my current email address".  Then enter that email address.  </p>

<p><em>Important: If you use this approach choose an entirely new password for this account--not the one currently use for email.  It’s always a security risk to use the same password for multiple sites.</em></p>

<p>Either approach--signing up for gmail or using your current email--creates a Google account that we’ll use for connecting to our tools.</p>

<h2>Using Google Groups</h2>

<p>Google Groups allows us to send an email to our whole group, review emails that have already been sent, and provide numerous other services for community conversations.</p>

<p><strong><em>How to I send an email to our Douglass-PAG group?</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a standard email</p></li>
<li><p>Address it to ‘<a href="mailto:douglass-pag@googlegroups.com">douglass-pag@googlegroups.com</a>’</p></li>
<li><p>Send</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The email is immediately sent to all members of the group.  It is also recorded in a forum that any member can review.</p>

<p><strong><em>How can I see an archive of all emails that have been sent in our Douglass-PAG group?</em></strong></p>

<li><p>An email will be sent to the group managers and someone will approve the membership</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Using Google tools</h2>

<p>Google offers a number of applications free-of-charge to Google users.  At the moment we will focus on three central tools:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Google Drive</strong>
Drive is a storage area for storing and sharing any kind of computer file.  It’s much like Dropbox.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Docs</strong>
Docs is a web-based word processor.  It’s considerably easier and less function-rich than Microsoft Word but satisfies the same need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Sheets</strong>
Sheets is a web-based spreadsheet.  Like Docs, it’s easier and less function-rich than the Microsoft-equivalent Excel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Google Docs and Sheets provide considerably more capability for allowing multiple people to work in a document at the same time.  It also has a rich mechanism for adding comments to a document (or spreadsheet) and for automatically storing all previous versions of it.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I get access to the Douglass-PAG ‘shared folder’?</em></strong></p>

<p>Google drive works like any file system: it contains files (of any kind) and folders that contain files or other folders.  Douglass-PAG has a pre-created folder that is a ‘shared folder’.  This means that the folder is pre-set to be used by everyone enrolled in the Douglass-PAG Google Group.  In other words, once you’re in the group you have access to the folder.</p>

<p>To access the Douglass-PAG shared-folder, click on the link:</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3ktxD2sFKPWLVhkS2FTSUcxSE0">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3ktxD2sFKPWLVhkS2FTSUcxSE0</a></p>

<p>It might be a good idea to cut-and-paste this URL into a browser bookmark for easier subsequent access.</p>

<p><strong><em>What will go into the Douglass-PAG folder?</em></strong></p>

<p>Anything we want to put there.  We anticipate things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Documents about the resistance; for example, the Indivisible Guide is already there.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual statements of any kind</p></li>
<li><p>Spreadsheets of resistance resources like collections of URLs for important websites</p></li>
<li><p>Spreadsheets of contact information for state and federal legislators, senate committees.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample text of letters or messages for a campaign</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Does everyone get to add or modify documents?  Won’t that cause chaos?</em></strong></p>

<p>Google tools were created with collaboration in mind.  Several features help out with this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Changes that anyone makes are instantly backed up into a ‘revision history’.  Even if a large chunk of a document is deleted it can be later viewed and recovered.</p></li>
<li><p>Documents can be created with many kinds of protection.  A document creator (owner) might want to ensure that no one else can make changes, but everyone can read it.  Alternatively a sub-group can collectively work on the document, even at the same time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t be careful with documents, especially documents owned by someone else.  Though recovery is always possible it can still be tedious.  Our general approach will be to start out with pretty open access and then see how it all goes.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I create a Google Doc (text)?</em></strong></p>

<p>Within the Douglass-PAG folder you will see a blue "New" button at the top left-hand side.  Clicking on the button opens a drop-down.  Select “Google Docs”, then “Blank document”.  (or “from Template” if desired).</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I create a Google Sheet (spreadsheet)?</em></strong></p>

<p>Within the Douglass-PAG folder you will see a blue "New" button at the top left-hand side.  Clicking on the button opens a drop-down.  Select “Google Sheets”.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I learn these tools?</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyone with experience with a word processor or spreadsheet should be able to get along without much assistance.  Beyond that there are hundreds of online resources: tutorials in both print and video.</p>

<p><strong><em>Will we use other tools than those mentioned above?</em></strong></p>

<p>We will use any tool that advances our objectives.  But those mentioned above will be our central tools.</p>

<p><strong><em>Anyone I can call for help?</em></strong></p>
