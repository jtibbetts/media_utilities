# OrganizeMusic

iTunes is the world's largest platform for loading, storing, and playing music.  Despite it's 
widespread commercial success it has long been known to have problems with certain approaches
to organizing music.  To get a clear picture of the problem let's examine key iTunes characterstics:

1. iTunes is primarily optimized for storing individual songs.  All the songs in iTunes are stored
in 'Music' or 'Library' (depending on the version of iTunes).
1. There is no inherent order of the songs in the Library.  In fact the songs can be sorted by various
header attributes (e.g., artist, album, name, etc).
1. Songs can be grouped into playlists.  They are sorted in the order in the playlist.  Unless shuffled,
they play in that order.
1. The default file layout of songs within iTunes (assuming storage is iTunes managed) is complex and
is not human readable.  This is especially true for large works (e.g. multi-volume sets of music, such
as an opera).  Different volumes within the set can even be layed out using a different structure.

These characteristics don't tend to create problems for simple sets of songs within iTunes.
